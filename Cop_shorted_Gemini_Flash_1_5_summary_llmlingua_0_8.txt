Fraction of Vegetation Cover 1999-2020 (raster 1 km), global, 10-daily - version 1
Fraction of vegetation Cover (FCOVER) corresponds to gap fraction for nadir direction. used to separate vegetation and soil in energy balance processes, including temperature and evapotranspiration. computed from leaf area index and other canopy structural variables does not depend on variables geometry of illumination as compared to FAPAR. For, good candidate for replacement of classical vegetation indices for monitoring of green vegetation. of linear relationship with radiometric signal, FCOVER only marginally scale dependent. Note similarly to LAI and FAPAR, only green elements will considered, belonging both to overstorey and understorey.

Leaf Area Index 1999-2020 (raster 1 km), global, 10-daily - version 1
LAI defined by CEOS as half developed area of convex hull wrapping green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. definition allows accounting for elements not flat such as needles or stems. LAI strongly non linearly related to reflectance. its estimation from remote sensing observations scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing canopy of different layers of vegetation, mandatory to consider all green layers. particularly important for forest canopies where understory may represent significant contribution to total canopy LAI. derived LAI corresponds to total green LAI, including contribution of green elements of understory.

Leaf Area Index 2014-present (raster 300 m), global, 10-daily - version 1
LAI defined by CEOS as half developed area of convex hull wrapping green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. definition allows accounting for elements not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. its estimation from remote sensing observations scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing canopy of different layers of vegetation, mandatory to consider all green layers. particularly important for forest canopies where understory may represent significant contribution to total canopy LAI. derived LAI corresponds to total green LAI, including contribution of green elements of understory. product at 333m resolution provided in Near Real Time and consolidated in next six periods.

SAR Sea Ice Berg Concentration and Individual Icebergs Observed with Sentinel-1
description: iceberg product contains 4 datasets (IW and EW modes and mosaic for two modes) describing iceberg concentration as number of icebergs counted within 10x10 km grid cells. iceberg concentration derived by applying Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm on data from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensors. iceberg product contains two additional datasets of individual iceberg positions in Greenland-Newfoundland-Labrador Waters. datasets in shapefile format best representation icebergs (the 1st dataset contains iceberg point observations, 2nd dataset contains polygonized satellite coverage). also derived by applying Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.
 Despite precision (individual icebergs proposed), product is generic and automated product needs expertise. For applications marine navigation, refer to national Ice Service of country concerned. DOI (product) :https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00129/moi-00129

Earth’s Radiation Budget (ERB) represents balance between incoming and outgoing radiant energy at Earth’s Top-of-the-Atmosphere. This Essential Climate Variable (ECV) is primary forcing of climate system a fundamental quantity to be monitored to understand Earth’s climate and variability. ERB comprises quantification of incoming radiation from Sun and outgoing reflected shortwave and emitted longwave radiation. ERB represents balance between incoming, predominantly solar, radiation and outgoing radiation as reflected solar radiation or thermal radiation emitted by Earth system. Earth is in of dynamic radiative balance, energy arriving from Sun balanced by outgoing radiation from top-of-the-atmosphere. Changes in Earth’s surface and atmosphere (including cloud amount properties, concentrations of greenhouse gases) alter radiative balance Earth system change balance and distribution of outgoing thermal radiation and reflected solar radiation. Aside from elevation (height) of sun above horizon, largest factor controlling variability in Earth radiation budget is cloud cover; fraction of cloud cover, height and opacity impact on reflected solar and outgoing infrared radiation. knowledge of cloud properties, with atmospheric composition and surface properties allows earth radiation budget to be computed. This catalogue entry comprises data from sources summarised in following sections.

Meridional Heat Transport: Key to Understanding Ocean Dynamics
 text describes Meridional Heat Transport (MHT), crucial element of Earth's climate system breakdown
 What is Meridional Heat Transport?
 MHT is movement of heat energy within ocean from equator towards poles measured by integrating heat fluxes across zonal direction (east to west) and vertically through ocean
 Why MHT Important?

 Earth's Energy Balance: Earth's energy budget maintained by MHT redistributes heat from tropics to higher latitudes
 Climate Regulation: MHT contributes to global climate patterns influencing weather systems regional temperatures
 Ocean Circulation: MHT driven by ocean currents major in shaping large-scale circulation patterns

 Key Findings:

 Spatial Variations MHT not uniform Variations in absorbed radiation basin geometry current systems lead to complex patterns of heat transport
 Variability MHT not static exhibits variations over time crucial for understanding climate change
 2016 Anomaly: unusually high global MHT in 2016 attributed to increased northward transport in Pacific during El Niño event
 2017 Trend: 2017 saw lower northward MHT in tropical band compared to 1993-2014 average in Atlantic and Indian/Pacific Oceans

 CMEMS Data
 CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service) provides MHT data for various basins (global Atlantic Indian/Pacific points data crucial for understanding current state future evolution of Earth's climate system
 Implications for Climate Change:
 Understanding MHT variations drivers essential for predicting future climate change scenarios Changes in MHT can lead to significant shifts in global climate patterns impacting weather extremes to sea level rise

 matters

 Sea level is critical Essential Ocean Variable affected by climate change
 Global mean sea level rise accelerated since 1990s due to warming oceans melting glaciers
 global rise accompanied by regional variations particularly in Mediterranean influenced by oceanographic meteorological factors
 Extreme sea level events exacerbated by storms pose threats to coastal communities leading to flooding erosion infrastructure damage.

 CMEMS Key Findings:

 indicator calculated for 11 tide gauge stations in Mediterranean most in Western Mediterranean
 99th percentiles reflect spatial variability of tidal regimes along coast ranging from 0.23 meters in Ibiza to 0.39 meters in Málaga
 Most stations show negative anomalies in 99th percentile for 2020 indicating lower than average extreme sea levels anomalies more pronounced towards north reaching -12 cm in Marseille.
 Some locations like Valencia and Ibiza exhibit positive anomalies suggesting higher than average extreme sea levels in 2020.

comprehensive description of ERA5 reanalysis dataset!'ve provided useful information about dataset's origins, methodology, variables, and access.
 summary of what I found particularly interesting:

 Data assimilation: process of combining model data with observations explained clearly. key aspect of reanalysis datasets.
 Uncertainty estimates: ERA5 provides uncertainty estimates, valuable for understanding reliability of data and for climate applications.
 Global coverage and high temporal resolution: dataset's global coverage and hourly resolution make it suitable for wide range of climate and weather studies.
 Detailed variable descriptions: descriptions of each variable helpful, including units, definitions, potential applications.

 few thoughts and potential improvements:

 Organization: could consider adding section headers to improve organization of document. make it easier for readers to quickly find information need.
 Links: links to articles and guidelines for accessing data are valuable, but could include more details about data access process. For example, could mention if any fees involved or if registration is required.
 Visualization: Adding figures or diagrams to illustrate data's spatial and temporal coverage or data assimilation process would make information more accessible and engaging.

 Overall, done great job of describing ERA5 dataset. information useful for anyone interested in using this dataset for research or other applications.

detailed description of ERA5 reanalysis dataset, long and technical for casual user. simplified summary:
 ERA5 is comprehensive global dataset for climate and weather:

 combines observations world with weather model to create complete consistent record.
 covers past 8 decades, with hourly estimates of various atmospheric, ocean, and land surface variables.
 ERA5 is improvement on previous ERA-Interim reanalysis.

 dataset includes:

 Hourly data: Temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover solar radiation sea surface temperature sea ice cover, many more.
 Monthly data: Averages of hourly data.
 Uncertainty estimates: Information on how reliable data is.

 Key points to remember:

 Back extension: ERA5 data available from 1940 onwards. preliminary version of data for 1950-1978 released, superseded by final release.
 Tropical cyclone intensity: preliminary version dataset may have exaggerated tropical cyclone intensity, recommended to use final release.
 Native resolution: Data available at higher resolution (native resolution) for more detailed analysis.
